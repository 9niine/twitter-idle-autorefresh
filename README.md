# Twitter Idle AutoRefresh

A Mozilla Firefox add-on that automatically reveals unread tweets every set seconds on Twitter feeds, so long as the customisable conditions are met. The primary goal of this add-on is to allow you to continiously read Twitter whilst doing other things on the side (e.g. work).

You may find a handful of options (including but not limited to the customisable conditions for the auto-refreshing procedure) through the Mozilla Firefox add-on's page (`about:addons`).

PS. The add-on will only work with the new Twitter design, as per July 2019.
PSS. Should you change the Twitter design in their Display settings, it is recommended that you refresh the page to re-initialise the add-on.

> As a privacy proponent myself, I would like to briefly state that this add-on will **NEVER** record any data whatsoever (e.g. browsing habits). It does however require the `storage` permission in order to save &amp; read its user settings. It will also only activate on URLs matching `*://twitter.com/*`.
