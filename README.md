# Twitter Idle AutoRefresh

A Mozilla Firefox add-on that automatically reveals unread tweets every 15 seconds on the Twitter home feed, so long as the page isn't focused and is scrolled to the top of the page.

The primary goal of the add-on is to allow a continuous Twitter feed whilst you work or do other stuff on the side. The add-on will activate so long as you meet the following criteria:

+ The page isn't focused
+ The page is scrolled to the very top of the page
+ The page is on the Twitter home feed

You can easily indicate whether the add-on is enabled by the Twitter logo at the very top left. If it's the blue default Twitter bird, then it's disabled. If it's the black Twitter bird with a refresh symbol within it (same as the add-on here on AMO), then the add-on is enabled.

_Disclaimer! Only tested with the new Twitter design, as per July, 2019._
